# Requirements

This site provides hands-on experience on a remote cluster. If you wish to create a single node test/demo cluster on your own AWS environment, you can follow the process [here](../00a-create-dfserver-aws.ipynb).

- Intel/AMD (x86_64)

- 16 cores

- 64GB Memory

- 150GB root disk

- 150GB block device (not a partition, not a formatted drive)
